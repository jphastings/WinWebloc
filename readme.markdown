WinWebloc
=========
A command line utility (written in Ruby with the help of exerb) that will open Mac OS X's `.webloc` files used to represent URL shortcuts.

Installation
------------
Put the winwebloc.exe somewhere on your computer (`C:\Program Files\winwebloc.exe` maybe?) then when you double click on a .webloc file (there's an example in this repository) you just need to associate this webloc.exe program with it, and the magic will happen!

Problems?
---------
I don't really use Windows, I wrote this app for a friend, so if you're having difficulty there's not a huge amount I can do, but I will try to help! Leave an 'issue' here on github and we'll see what we can do.

Tested with Mac OS X 10.6.3 and Windows 7

To Do
-----
* Make a pretty installer that includes file association setup and icons
* Add more cowbell
