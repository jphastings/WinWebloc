WinWebloc
=========
A command line utility (written in Ruby with the help of [ocra](http://github.com/larsch/ocra)) that will open Mac OS X's `.webloc` files used to represent URL shortcuts.

Installation
------------
Download [the installer](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/jphastings/WinWebloc/WinWebloc_Installer.exe) and run it! Everything is done for you - WinWebloc will be installed to C:\Program Files\WinWebloc\winwebloc.exe and the filetype associations will be made so that you can just double click on the links.

Problems?
---------
I don't really use Windows, I wrote this app for a friend, so if you're having difficulty there's not a huge amount I can do, but I will try to help! Leave an 'issue' here on github and we'll see what we can do.

Tested with Mac OS X 10.6.3 and Windows 7

To Do
-----
* Get rid of the console box when opening the .weblocs
